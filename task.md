# Task: Complete Vitest Migration

## Goal

Remove remaining Jest dependencies and configuration files to fully standardize on Vitest for testing, as outlined in `plan.md` (section 3.2) and the main worklog (`docs/worklog/2025-04-06-planning-and-test-fixing.md`, step 2).

## Steps

1.  **Remove Dependencies:** Edit `package.json` and remove `jest` and `ts-jest` from the `devDependencies` section.
2.  **Delete Config:** Delete the `jest.config.js` file from the project root.
3.  **Update Lockfile:** Run `npm install` to update `package-lock.json` based on the changes in `package.json`.
4.  **Verify Tests:** Run `npm run test` to ensure all tests still pass correctly using only the Vitest configuration and runner.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `jest` and `ts-jest` are removed from `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.
- `jest.config.js` file is deleted.
- Running `npm run test` executes successfully and all tests pass.

## Next Steps

- Proceed with the implementation steps outlined above.

## Completion Status

**Completed:** All steps have been successfully executed.
- Jest dependencies (`jest`, `ts-jest`) removed from `package.json`.
- `jest.config.js` deleted.
- `package-lock.json` updated via `npm install`.
- `npm run test` confirmed all tests pass with Vitest.
The Vitest migration is now fully complete.
