# Worklog: 2025-04-06 - Fix Failing Tests

This log tracks the steps taken to address the failing tests mentioned in `task.md`.

## Plan

- [x] Investigate timeouts in `test/integration.test.ts`.
    - [x] Read `test/integration.test.ts`.
    - [x] Identify specific tests timing out.
    - [x] Analyze the cause of timeouts (CDK synth).
    - [x] Implement fixes (increased timeout to 30s).
- [x] Investigate timeouts in `test/workflow.test.ts`.
    - [x] Read `test/workflow.test.ts`.
    - [x] Identify specific tests timing out (`state machine has correct configuration`, `state machine ARN is correctly exposed`).
    - [x] Analyze the cause of timeouts (CDK synth, stack instantiation).
    - [x] Implement fixes (increased timeout to 30s for both tests).
- [x] Address other failures mentioned in `task.md` (after timeouts) - None found, only timeouts listed.
- [x] Run all tests to confirm fixes - All 10 tests passed.
- [ ] (If applicable) Deploy changes.
- [ ] (If applicable) Test deployed endpoint.
