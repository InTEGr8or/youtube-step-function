# 2025-04-06 Planning and Test Fixing Worklog

## Planning Phase

- [x] Task 1: Review existing worklogs (`docs/worklog/*`).
- [x] Task 2: Run project tests (`npm run test`). Result: 4 tests failed due to timeouts (integration/workflow tests).
- [x] Task 3: Create a detailed plan (`plan.md`) for remaining functionality. This includes: robust YouTube download (fallback logic), integrating downloads into Step Functions, fixing failing tests, and migrating fully to Vitest.
- [x] Task 4: Review the created plan (`plan.md`) with the user for feedback and approval. (Feedback incorporated: No retry on primary download method).
- [x] Task 5: Write the approved plan to `docs/plan.md`.
- [x] Task 6: Switch to 'code' mode to implement the plan. (Sub-tasks created).

## Implementation Phase (Based on plan.md)

1.  [x] **Fix Tests:** Address the 4 failing tests first to establish a stable baseline. (Completed in sub-task: Increased timeouts). See `docs/worklog/2025-04-06-fix-failing-tests.md`.
2.  [x] **Migrate Tests:** Remove Jest dependencies and configuration, ensuring all tests pass with Vitest. (Completed in sub-task).
3.  [x] **Research:** Confirm `yt-dlp` as the fallback and determine the best integration method. (Completed: Recommended approach is custom Lambda Layer with `yt-dlp` binary + Python, using `yt-dlp-exec` wrapper with `YOUTUBE_DL_SKIP_DOWNLOAD=true`, and streaming to S3).
4.  [ ] **Implement Download Logic:**
    *   [ ] Update the primary `download-video.ts` Lambda with improved error handling.
    *   [ ] Implement the fallback download mechanism (either in the same Lambda or a new one).
5.  [ ] **Update Step Function:** Modify the state machine definition in the CDK stack.
6.  [ ] **Testing:** Perform thorough unit, integration (using the fixed tests), and end-to-end testing (using `invoke-video.http`).
7.  [ ] **Deployment:** Deploy the updated stack.
