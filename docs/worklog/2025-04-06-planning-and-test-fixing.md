# 2025-04-06 Planning and Test Fixing Worklog

## Initial Task List

- [x] Task 1: Review existing worklogs (`docs/worklog/*`).

- [ ] Task 4: Review the created plan (`plan.md`) with the user for feedback and approval.
- [ ] Task 5: Write the approved plan to `docs/plan.md`.
- [ ] Task 6: Switch to 'code' mode to implement the plan.
