## Task
Fix environment variable naming mismatch between .envrc and stack code

## Problem
The stack code was looking for S3_BUCKET_NAME but the .envrc file had BUCKET_NAME defined. This caused environment variable validation to fail.

## Solution
Updated youtube-step-function-stack.ts to use BUCKET_NAME instead of S3_BUCKET_NAME to match the .envrc file.

## Changes Made
- Modified youtube-step-function-stack.ts to use BUCKET_NAME
- Verified .envrc contains all required variables with correct names

## Next Steps
- Commit changes with descriptive message
- Deploy and test the updated stack
