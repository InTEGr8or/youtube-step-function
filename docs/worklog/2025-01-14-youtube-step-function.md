## Task
Update S3 permissions for the thumbnail download Lambda function in the YouTube Step Function CDK stack.

## Understanding
The downloadThumbnail Lambda function needs both Put and PutAcl permissions on the videoBucket to properly store and manage access control for thumbnails.

## Plan
1. Update the CDK stack to grant Put and PutAcl permissions to the downloadThumbnail function
2. Verify the permissions are correctly applied in the generated CloudFormation template

## Implementation
Updated the stack.ts file to replace:
```typescript
videoBucket.grantReadWrite(downloadThumbnail);
```
with:
```typescript
videoBucket.grantPut(downloadThumbnail);
videoBucket.grantPutAcl(downloadThumbnail);
```

## Next Steps
- Test the updated permissions by deploying the stack
- Verify the thumbnail download functionality works as expected
- Add error handling for cases where thumbnails are not available
